# Bluegg Module Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to create NPM compatible modules using ES2015

Get started by forking this and changing the name/origin or whatever.
```shell
npm install
```

Write your module. Then:

```shell
npm run build
# Then...
npm link
```

Check it works by running
```shell
npm link modulename
```
(this is like NPM installing but from your computer)

Once your happy, write up a readme explaining how to install, create a demo (maybe on [codepen](http://codepen.io)?). Give credit to whoever inspired it.

Check it into Github (or wherever) and then publish to NPM
```shell
npm publish
```
